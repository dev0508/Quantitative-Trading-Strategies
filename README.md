**Momentum Based**

I calculate the percentile returns over multiple time periodsâ€”1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year. Based on these returns, I select stocks for my portfolio that exhibit strong momentum over these periods. I write the final output to an excel file.

**Value Based**

I evaluate stocks using several valuation metrics such as the Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio, Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratio, Price-to-Sales (P/S) Ratio, EV/EBITDA, and EV/GP. By assessing these, I select undervalued stocks that show potential for future returns. I write the final output to an excel file.

**Equal Weight S&P 500**

I construct the user's portfolio by equally investing in all companies listed in the S&P 500. I write the final output to an excel file.
